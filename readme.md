# MPA Boilerplate

This is an experimental boilerplate code for the following stack

1. Go lang (services/backend)
2. Go Templates + Alpine - for templating and a bit of interactivity using alpine
3. Redis for persistence / the [`storage/db.go`](storage/db.go) can be modified accordingly to handle your db operations or however you like to structure it.
4. `.env` for environment configurations
5. `gomon` for development server

This is as an evaluation project for the same being used for more complex stuff that I might write.
Feel free to use the template.
